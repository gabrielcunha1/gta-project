# GTA Project 🏙️

This project was created as a study practice to improve my web development skills.

Throughout this project, I worked with:
- HTML5 for structure 📝
- CSS3 for styling and layout 🎨
- JavaScript for interactivity 💻

The main goal was to practice building a visually appealing landing page inspired by the GTA universe.
